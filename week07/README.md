### Lecture 4: Deep Learning 201
In this lecture, we talk about more advanced concepts of DL, like convolutional neural networks, pooling, transfer learning, learning rate scheduling, hyper parameter tuning, etc. 

#### Reading (same as DL101 - these are very useful papers):
-  A disciplined approach to neural network hyper-parameters: Part 1 -- learning rate, batch size, momentum, and weight decay, Leslie N. Smith  
-  Bag of Tricks for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks, Tong He, Zhi Zhang, Hang Zhang, Zhongyue Zhang, Junyuan Xie, Mu Li  
-  The [1Cycle Policy](https://sgugger.github.io/the-1cycle-policy.html), Sylvain Gugger  
-  Pytorch [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html )
