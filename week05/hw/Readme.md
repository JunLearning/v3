# Homework 5 - Deep Learning Frameworks

This is a graded homework

Due just before week 6 session

This homework will focus on PyTorch and possibly PyTorch Lightning.  The students would be required to pick a pre-trained model and fine tune it, writing the loop from scratch

Finally, the students will need to transfer their trained model to the Jetson device and demonstrate its performance / quality there.
Optinally, the students could demonstrate that the model could be trained on the Jetson.
