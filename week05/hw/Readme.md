# Homework 5 - Deep Learning Frameworks

Due just before week 6 session

This homework will focus on PyTorch and possibly PyTorch Lightning.  The students would be required to pick a pre-trained model and fine tune it, writing the loop from scratch

Alternatively, the students would be required to create their own design of a model and train it from random weights.
