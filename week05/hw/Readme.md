# Homework 5 - Deep Learning Frameworks

This is a graded homework

Due just before week 6 session

This homework will focus on PyTorch and possibly PyTorch Lightning.  The students would be required to pick a pre-trained model and fine tune it, writing the loop from scratch

The ideas are:
1. The dataset will be small, so the models will overfit
2. What is the model architecture that they will pick large vs small?
3. What are the data augmentation techniques? did they use any?
4. What framework was the easiest to use
5. Focus on image classification for now
6. What is the image size

Finally, the students will need to transfer their trained model to the Jetson device and demonstrate its performance / quality there.
Optinally, the students could demonstrate that the model could be trained on the Jetson.

If your model is big, it will be slow on the jetson
