Lab 5 - Deep Learning Framework

These labs will focus on exercises related to  TensorFlow 2 , PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning

Basic training loops and validation / inference.

We will cover ML containers on the Jetson such that students can experiment with major frameworks in Jupyter on the edge.
Note that the graded homework 5 follows this lab, so these exercises would prepare the students.
