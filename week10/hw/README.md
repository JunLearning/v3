#GANs refined
In this week's lab, you used a GAN to generate images of people that look like celebrities.

For this homework, you will re-run the lab with modifications to improve the quality of the generated images. The easiest improvements can be made by modifying values in the **_Inputs_** section

###Submission:
1. What changes did you make to the original lab? Did your changes result in higher quality images?
2. In your own words, how does the Discriminator improve its ability to detect fakes?
3. Share a copy of the outpt image from the last step in the notebook (can be an upload to the ISVC Portal, or a link to the file in AWS Object Store).
