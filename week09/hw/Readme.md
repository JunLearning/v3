# Homework 9 - Distributed training

This is a graded homework

Due: before week 10 begins

This homework will be focused on aspects of multi-gpu and multi-node model training.
The current idea is to train an object detector network on custom data

Alternatively, the students would be required to create their own design of a model and train it from random weights.

Finally, the students need to demonstrate that their Jetson device can use the trained model for inference
Multi-node.. perhaps using PyTorch DDP or pytorch lightning eventually
