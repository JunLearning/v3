# Homework 9 - Distributed training

This is a graded homework

Due: before week 10 begins

In this homework, we are focused on aspects of multi-node and multi-gpu (mnmg) model training.
The high level idea is to practice running multi-node training by adapting the code we develop in homework 5 to run on two nodes instead of one.

Notes:
* You will need to provision two g4dn.2xlarge instances. Each has 8 vCPUs, so you'll need to the ability (limit) to provision 16 vCPUs. 
* You'll need to provision a 300 GB EFS volume and mount it on both instances
*
