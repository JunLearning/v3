# Homework 8

Due before week 9 session begins

This homework will be focused on aspects of dataset preparation, including data annotation, using active learning, using a tool like Toronto Suite or similar

We may want to include aspects of large scale data pre-processing as well

Perhaps the homework could be open ended - e.g. the students could  choose a public dataset of their choice, pre-process it, annotate it.
