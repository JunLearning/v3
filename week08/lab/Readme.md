# Lab 8


These labs will be focused on aspects of dataset preparation, including data annotation, using active learning, 
using a tool like Toronto Suite or similar

Start with the latest in data loaders -- including Dali and NVTabular data loaders - fast , dealing with augmentation, dealing with feature extraction. Rely on [JoC examples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples)

We may want to include aspects of large scale data pre-processing as well
