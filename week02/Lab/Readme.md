# Lab02: Cloud ML Services - Sagemaker

This lab further builds on using public cloud services with a primer on AWS Sagemaker. Sagemaker is a fully managed Machine Learning Service enabling 
to easily build, train and deploy ML models with an integrated Jupyter Notebook instance. 


# Setup and run Sagemaker Example

-   Readup details on Sagemaker. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ex1-preprocess-data.html
-   
-   Create Sagemaker notebook instance.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-console.html

-   Create a jupyter notebook and save it. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ex1-prepare.html

-   Run the end to end Example https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/1P_kmeans_highlevel/kmeans_mnist.ipynb
(This incl. downloading MNIST dataset to your account's default S3 Object storage)

-   Once complete, Login to your account and check the resources the example created

-   Cleanup the environment by deleting the deployed endpoint, Notebook instance and S3 to not incur AWS charges


# Discuss ML services 

-   How can Sagemaker help Data Scientists
  
-   Advantages/Disadvantages of Sagemaker

-   Integration of Sagemaker with other AWS services such as Lambda functions, Kubernetes etc.,

-  When to use what algorithms

-  What are other ML services available from other cloud service providers such as Google, Microsoft, IBM?
